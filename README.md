# About this repository.

I own the copyright to this software.  
I release this software under [the MIT license](LICENSE).  
Please feel free to use it.

However, you must provide any third-party assets that you use.  
I will list the additional assets needed in the `SetUp`.

This project is very old,  
so you may need to modify some of it to fit the latest development environment.

## About Resources folder

The software can call the assets under the resources folder directly from the script.

Here is the file structure of the resources folder.

```
Resources
- Dino
- DinoCaptured
- DinoPic
- DinoSilhouette
- Sounds
```

I have placed some assets related to dinosaurs under this folder.
Some of the 2D assets have been heavily modified, so it is safe to say that they are my work.
However, the sound files for the dinosaur sounds have been used in their original form.
Therefore, I have deleted `Sound` folder. You need to make the folder yourself.

You will have to purchase the 3D assets of the dinosaurs.
(The dinosaur sound files are also included.)

For the assets in `Dino` folder, you need to purchase the dinosaur 3D assets.
Because I deleted the dinosaur assets, the references are now `missing` and you will have to re-link them.

## Font

I used a free font set that is `NotoSansCJKjp-Black`.
I deleted it in this public repository, so you need to put the font under `Fonts` folder.

Please use `Font Asset Creator` of Text Mesh Pro to update the font material.

## Icons

You can find them in the `Textures` folder.
